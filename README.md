# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

## Overview of the Analysis:
Using SQL we determined the number of retiring employees per title and identified employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program. By analyzing the data we are helping Pewlett Hackard prepare for future employee retirement.

## Results Analyzing 'Retiring Titles':
- Of those reaching retirement, nearly 50% are Engineers.
- Of those reaching retirement, over 70% are designated as Senior.

## Results Analyzing 'Mentorship Eligibilty':
- Implementing a mentorship strategy will be crucial in maintain employment levels.
- Due to the smaller list of available mentors, the company will need to deploy other strategies to mentorship prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami".

## Summary:
There are over 72 thousand roles that will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" starts. 

There are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. There are 1,549 qualified but not all would be willing to participate in a mentoring program.

Instead of looking for retirement-ready employees, we should expand our search for employees with 8 years of experience or more and senior employees with over 4 years of experience to increase the mentoring pool.  

Another query or table that may provide more insight would be to review employees who have had several titles at the company to help mentor lower level employees and give them a path of success.
